# MOTScope

MOTScope is a lightweight browser-based visual inspection tool for multi-object tracking datasets, detections, ground truth annotations, and tracker outputs.

![MOTScope interface](docs/assets/motscope_interface.png)

Repository: https://github.com/shijunjie07/MOTScope

## Overview

MOTScope helps inspect MOT-style datasets without writing one-off visualization scripts. It is designed for quick validation of dataset structure, annotation quality, detection quality, sequence metadata, and tracking outputs.

The app runs locally with Flask and keeps user dataset configuration under `instance/`, so datasets can be registered without editing source code.

## Features

- Browse image sequences frame by frame.
- Display bounding boxes, IDs, visibility text, and detection scores.
- Show ground truth and detections together with independent colors.
- Support multiple annotation layers with layer visibility controls.
- Switch datasets, splits, sequences, and annotation sources in the browser.
- Register custom datasets from the UI or local JSON configuration.
- Use smooth video playback through cached MP4 generation.
- Export annotated or raw frames, image ZIPs, and MP4 videos.
- Start export downloads automatically, with a `Download again` fallback link.
- Use a light theme by default, with a persistent dark theme option.
- Choose White Grid, Black Grid, Plain White, or Plain Black viewer backgrounds.
- Zoom in and zoom out below fit size, with pan/drag controls.
- Store local dataset configuration separately from source-controlled files.

## Supported Datasets

| Dataset | Description | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SoccerNet-Tracking | Soccer broadcast video dataset for multi-object tracking. | https://github.com/SoccerNet/sn-tracking |
| DanceTrack | Multi-human tracking dataset with similar appearance and complex motion. | https://dancetrack.github.io/ |
| SportsMOT | Multi-sport tracking benchmark with sports video sequences. | https://github.com/MCG-NJU/SportsMOT |

Other MOT-style datasets can be added when their image folders and annotation files can be mapped to the expected structure.

## Supported Dataset Structure

Default MOT-style layout:

```text
<dataset-root>/
  <split>/
    <sequence>/
      img1/
        000001.jpg
        000002.jpg
        ...
      gt/
        gt.txt
      det/
        det.txt
      seqinfo.ini       # optional
      gameinfo.ini      # optional
```

Notes:

- `img1/` is the default image directory.
- `gt/` contains ground-truth annotation files.
- `det/` may contain detection files such as `det.txt`.
- `seqinfo.ini` and `gameinfo.ini` are optional.
- Custom layouts can be registered through the dataset configuration.

## Annotation Format

MOTScope expects MOTChallenge-style comma-separated annotation rows:

```text
frame,id,x,y,w,h,confidence,class,unused,visibility
```

Key fields used by the viewer:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `frame` | MOT frame number |
| `id` | Object or track identity |
| `x, y, w, h` | Bounding box position and size |
| `confidence` | Detection score when available |
| `visibility` | Optional visibility value used for review/highlighting |

Malformed annotation lines are skipped and reported as warnings instead of crashing the viewer.

## Multi-Layer Annotations

Existing configs that only define `gt_files` still work. To show GT and detections together, add `annotation_layers` to a dataset entry:

```json
{
  "name": "sportsmot",
  "root": "/path/to/SportsMOT/dataset",
  "splits": ["train", "val", "test"],
  "image_dir": "img1",
  "gt_files": ["gt.txt"],
  "annotation_layers": [
    {
      "name": "Ground Truth",
      "type": "gt",
      "path": "gt/gt.txt",
      "color": "#00ff00",
      "visible": true,
      "draw_id": true,
      "draw_score": false
    },
    {
      "name": "Detections",
      "type": "det",
      "path": "det/det.txt",
      "color": "#ff9900",
      "visible": true,
      "draw_id": false,
      "draw_score": true,
      "score_threshold": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
```

Layer paths are relative to each sequence folder, such as `<dataset-root>/<split>/<sequence>/gt/gt.txt`. If `annotation_layers` is omitted, MOTScope derives a Ground Truth layer from `gt_files` and, when present, a Detections layer from `det/det.txt`.

Layer cards live in the left sidebar. Each card has a color swatch, layer name, type badge, master **Show this layer** switch, display options, and score threshold.

## Dataset Registration

By default, dataset definitions are stored in:

```text
instance/datasets.json
```

This file is local configuration and should not be committed.

To register a dataset from the UI, use **File -> Add Dataset...** and provide:

- dataset name
- dataset root path
- available splits
- optional folder and filename settings

To use a different config path, set the legacy environment variable:

```bash
export MOT_VIEWER_DATASETS_CONFIG=/path/to/datasets.json
```

## Smooth Playback

MOTScope has two playback modes:

- **Frame Inspection** keeps precise image-by-image navigation, hover, locked-box inspection, zoom, and pan.
- **Smooth Video** generates or reuses a cached MP4 under `instance/video_cache/`, plays it in a `<video>` element, and draws selected annotation layers on a synchronized canvas overlay.

Smooth playback requires `ffmpeg` on the system path. The video cache validates duration with `ffprobe`; stale or too-short cached files are regenerated.

## Export

Use **File -> Export...** to export:

| Export Target | Formats |
| --- | --- |
| Current Frame | `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `svg` |
| Whole Sequence as Images ZIP | `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `svg` |
| Whole Sequence as Video | `mp4` |

Exports can include no annotations, currently visible layers, or custom selected layers. Generated files are written under `instance/exports/`. The browser download starts automatically after completion, and a `Download again` link remains available.

## ROI Batch Export

Use **ROI Export** in the top toolbar to draw one rectangular crop region on the current frame. Drag inside the rectangle to move it, drag a corner handle to resize it, or edit **X**, **Y**, **Width**, and **Height** in the export dialog. ROI coordinates are stored in native source-image pixels.

Open **File -> Export...** and choose **ROI Batch Export** to configure:

| Setting | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Frames | Current frame, current frame to end, whole sequence, or custom inclusive range |
| Content | Raw, Annotated, or Raw + Annotated |
| Annotated rendering | Crop current rendered view, or re-render annotations inside crop |
| Output | Image sequence, video, or both |
| Image destination | ZIP download, plus folder saving in browsers that expose directory access |

ZIP output is always generated as the fallback for image sequences. Folder saving uses the browser File System Access API when available; unsupported browsers keep ZIP download enabled.

Only one ROI is active at a time. Drawing a new ROI replaces the old one. The ROI persists across frame navigation and across sequences with the same native resolution. It is cleared when a new sequence uses a different native width or height.

## Canvas Background and Zoom

MOTScope supports different viewer canvas backgrounds, including White Grid, Black Grid, Plain White, and Plain Black. The default is White Grid. The canvas background is only used in the viewer workspace and does not modify the original image, video, or exported dataset files.

The canvas background can be changed from **View -> Canvas Background**, the left Display section, or the floating **BG** control. The selected background is saved in the browser and is independent from the app light/dark theme.

Viewer zoom supports 10% to 800%. The image or video can be zoomed out below fit size, making the grid workspace visible around the sequence frame. **Fit** returns to fit-to-screen, and **100%** shows original pixel scale when feasible.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Ctrl + mouse wheel | Zoom in or out around the cursor |
| Ctrl + + | Zoom in |
| Ctrl + - | Zoom out |
| Ctrl + 0 | Fit or reset view |
| Shift + left drag | Pan the image or video |
| Space + left drag | Pan, if enabled |
